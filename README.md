- 🌍 Add your people by clicking on the map or uploading a .csv.
- 🌍 Group your people my team.
- 🌍 With 2+ people added, see the CO₂ impact of the group's flights.
- 🌍 Explore the suggested meeting location which optimize for co₂ impact and the "home" location of at least one group member.
- 🌍 Change your analysis by selecting and de-selecting individuals or teams. Information is stored locally.

## Motivation
The climate crisis is wreaking havoc on the world, and flights are the most carbon-intensive activity most individuals partake in. However, flights are a necessary tool in modern society. Remote companies, conference organizers, and event managers could make a real impact by optimizing their meeting locations to reduce their CO₂ impact. 

## Limitations
- Actual routing isn't factored in (because routing data is expensive and proprietary), meaning that only direct flights are being calculated, whether or not the direct flight actually exists.
- Only flights are factored in at this time (no option for other modes of transporation)
